# Data Permissions

This repo is for collecting initiatives to gain permissions / compliance statements from data owners to use to improve OSM.

If you planning to getting in touch with a data owner because you found some open data that you think can be useful for OSM, you have come to the right place. Work through these steps:

1. Open a [new issue](https://github.com/osmlab/data-permissions/issues/new) in this repo.
2. Find the license for the data. If the license for the data is [compatible](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/ODbL_Compatibility), you don't need to seek permission. Please still continue below, you are not done but you can skip some steps below.
3. Use one of the [templates available](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/GettingPermission) to craft a message to the data owner.
4. If you don't get a response, try calling. Ask your local community friends for help if you need it.
5. Keep a log of all correspondence in the issue comments, including the details of the person(s) you are in touch with.
6. Once you receive explicit permission, close the issue. Don't forget to copy / attach all correspondence! 
7. Inform the local community.

## A Note On Importing

There are many ways to improve OSM based on external data. Importing is one of them, but it's the most invasive and often not the easiest or desired solution. Before you start thinking about importing, please read the [Import Guidelines] and get in touch with your local community.
